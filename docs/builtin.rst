Built-in Functions
==================

There are a few built-in functions for manipulating :ref:`expression values <expressionvalues>` in CORE. Each built-in function expression begins with an identifier followed by a ``(`` character. A built-in function expression term evaluates to the output of the function. You can determine the behavior of the built-in functions in the documents below.
