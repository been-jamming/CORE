Building and Installing
=======================

.. _build:

Build
-----

With `make` installed, clone the official `repository`_ first. Navigate into the directory `CORE`, and run the following::
	make
.. code-block:: rst

The binary `CORE/core` is created. A directory `CORE/build` is created containing intermediate object files used during the build process.

Install
-------

Install CORE manually by copying the binary `CORE/core` into the appropriate directory (usually `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`).
