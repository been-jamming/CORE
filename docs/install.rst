Building and Installing
=======================

Build
-----

With ``make`` installed, clone the official `repository`_ first. Navigate into the directory ``CORE``, and run the following:

.. code-block:: console

	make

The binary ``CORE/core`` is created. A directory ``CORE/build`` is created containing intermediate object files used during the build process.

.. _repository: https://github.com/been-jamming/CORE

Install
-------

Install CORE manually by copying the binary ``CORE/core`` into the appropriate directory (usually ``/usr/local/bin`` or ``/usr/bin``).
